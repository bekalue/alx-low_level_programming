# ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING.

## Description

At Alx SE Program, we learn by doing. We have projects everyday that we have to push on GitHub in order for an automatic review to be done. This repository contains directories each corresponding to a low level programming project. These projects are part of the [Alx SE program](https://www.alxafrica.com//) one year curriculum. In these projects, we cover everything from the basics to more advanced topics.

## Objective

Understand low level programming language like C and Unix system work or “what is
going on under the hood”
